## **Use Case**

Consider a fast-growing tech startup based in the United States that has developed a cutting-edge SaaS platform. To accelerate their European market entry, they need to hire a Sales Manager in Germany and a Marketing Specialist in France.

**The Challenge:** Traditionally, setting up legal entities in Germany and France would involve significant upfront costs, months of bureaucratic processes, and the need to navigate complex local labor laws, payroll systems, and tax regulations. This would divert crucial resources and delay their market entry strategy.

**Multiplier's Solution:** By partnering with Multiplier, the startup can bypass the need for local entity setup and hire their Sales Manager and Marketing Specialist quickly and compliantly.

- **Rapid Onboarding:** Using Multiplier's platform, the startup can onboard both employees within a few weeks. Multiplier generates localized employment contracts in German and French, ensuring full legal compliance.
- **Effortless Payroll:** Multiplier handles the payroll for both employees in Euros (€), managing German and French tax deductions and social security contributions accurately and on time. The startup avoids the complexities of managing two different international payroll systems.
- **Localized Benefits:** Multiplier facilitates the provision of locally relevant benefits packages that meet the legal requirements and market standards in Germany and France, ensuring employee satisfaction and compliance.
- **Ongoing Compliance:** Multiplier continuously monitors changes in German and French labor laws, proactively alerting the startup to any necessary adjustments in their employment practices.
- **Focus on Core Business:** The startup can now focus its resources and energy on sales and marketing activities in the European market, rather than getting bogged down in HR and legal complexities.

Multiplier acts as a strategic enabler, allowing the tech startup to expand its global footprint efficiently and cost-effectively, accessing the talent they need to drive their European market success without the traditional administrative burdens.
